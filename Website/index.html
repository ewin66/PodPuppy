            Podpuppy is a free Podcatcher for Windows. You can use it to subscribe to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast"
                        target="_blank">Podcasts</a> and automatically receive sound and video files
            as they are released by the author. PodPuppy is very easy to use while supporting
            all the major podcast formats and providing all the essential functions of a podcast
            receiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made PodPuppy in my spare time and I will continue to support it and add features
            as they are requested. PodPuppy will always be free.
